# Flex-Respone-Chart
Any website that end with '.com' response time displayed on a chart.

# Why?
Well it was really late at night and I found this [go-charts](https://github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts) repository. So I implemented using the data of response time of my university portal. *side note that : I was really bored too.*
